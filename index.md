## Hi! I am Isin.

<!--<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">-->

I am a senior undergraduate student at Hacettepe University, Department of Biology. 

I am interested in bioinformatics and population genomics, more specifically developing methods & statistical frameworks. Evolutionary biology is fascinating yet has very challenging computational questions!
